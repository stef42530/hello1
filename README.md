**Markdown** is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers:

## definitions
a **repository** is usually used to organize a single project. 
  - Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. 
  - We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. 
  
a **commit** is the making of a set of tentative changes permanent.  

After your new repository,  Create a **Branch**
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
By default your repository has one branch named **master** which is considered to be the definitive branch. 
We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.
To create a new branch:

1.  Go to your new repository hello-world.
2.  Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
3.  Type a branch name, *readme-edits*, into the new branch text box.
4.  Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.

Now you have two branches, master and *readme-edits*. 
They look exactly the same, but not for long! Next we’ll add our changes to the new branch.
Let’s make some edits.
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits and each commit has an associated **commit message**, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. 
Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

Now that you have changes in a branch off of master, you can open a **pull request**.
Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. 
When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. 
Pull requests show **diffs**, or differences, of the content from both branches. 
The changes:

- additions, is shown in green
- subtractions is shown in red

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request 
and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together – **merging your readme-edits branch** into the master branch.

1. Click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master.
2. Click Confirm merge.
3. Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the Delete branch button in the purple box.

***
Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time, and without stepping on each other's toes. It's a distributed version control system.

Tou can also use :
a desktop version (with a graphic interface or command line)

or a web service:
[github terminal] (https://try.github.io/] "command line")  

***
create new files...
now if you want to  test your code (javascript,HTML,CSS):

A)
go to [code js test] (http://codepen.io/al-the-x/pen/rVjqRj] "code online") 
It's not free!!!
it uses hello.js [js library with git API authenticating] (https://github.com/MrSwitch/hello.js/ "perfect js")

B) use [pages github] (https://pages.github.com/ "page hosted by git")
