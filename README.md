## definitions
a **repository** is usually used to organize a single project. 
  - Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. 
  - We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. 
  
a **commit** is the making of a set of tentative changes permanent.  

After your new repository,  Create a **Branch**
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
By default your repository has one branch named **master** which is considered to be the definitive branch. 
We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.
To create a new branch:

1.  Go to your new repository hello-world.
2.  Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
3.  Type a branch name, *readme-edits*, into the new branch text box.
4.  Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.

Now you have two branches, master and *readme-edits*. 
They look exactly the same, but not for long! Next we’ll add our changes to the new branch.
